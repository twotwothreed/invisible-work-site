This work is often gendered, disproportionately affecting women in roles like receptionists, teachers, or caregivers.</p>      <div class="quote">“Women are often expected to smooth over conflict, uplift morale, and support their colleagues emotionally — all without acknowledgment or compensation.”</div>    </section>    <section id="the-office">      <h2>As Seen on <em>The Office</em></h2>      <p>Characters like Pam Beesly and Jan Levinson illustrate emotional labor in a fictional setting. Pam, though hired as a receptionist, spends much of her time calming her boss and managing office dynamics. Jan, a high-level executive, is penalized for showing emotion in a way male characters aren't.</p>      <ul>        <li><strong>"Dream Team"</strong>: Pam supports Michael during his startup anxieties.</li>        <li><strong>"Dinner Party"</strong>: Jan’s emotional breakdown is portrayed as instability.</li>        <li><strong>"Beach Games"</strong>: Pam calls out being overlooked despite her dedication.</li>      </ul>    </section>    <section id="real-world">      <h2>Real-World Connections</h2>      <p>Emotional labor mirrors real workplace trends: Women are often expected to maintain workplace harmony while being denied leadership opportunities. According to a 2023 study, women perform nearly twice as much emotional support work in office settings as men.</p>      <p>Media like <em>The Office</em> highlight these issues through satire — but the root problems remain unresolved in many workplaces today.</p>    </section>    <section id="action">      <h2>How You Can Help</h2>      <ul>        <li>Acknowledge emotional labor in performance reviews.</li>        <li>Distribute caretaking tasks equally, regardless of gender.</li>        <li>Encourage emotional transparency for all employees — not just women.</li>        <li>Support leadership development for those in support roles.</li>      </ul>    </section>    <section id="about">      <h2>About This Project</h2>      <p>This site was created as a public-facing companion to a research paper analyzing NBC's <em>The Office</em> through Marxist and feminist theory. The goal is to bring attention to gendered workplace dynamics and the undervalued emotional labor many workers — especially women — perform daily.</p>    </section>  </div>  <footer>    <p>&copy; 2025 The Invisible Work Project | For educational use only</p>  </footer></body></html>
